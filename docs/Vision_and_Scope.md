# Optivise - Vision and Scope Document

## Project Vision
Optivise transforms how Optimizely developers interact with AI by serving as an intelligent intermediary that provides curated, contextual information about Optimizely products to Large Language Models. Instead of generic AI responses, developers receive precise, up-to-date, and actionable guidance tailored to their specific Optimizely product context.

## Project Overview
Optivise is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool that analyzes developer prompts for Optimizely relevance and provides curated context to LLMs. The tool intelligently detects which Optimizely products are being used, reads existing IDE rules, and delivers focused information that enhances AI interactions without overwhelming the system with irrelevant data.

## Strategic Objectives

### 1. **Revolutionize AI-Assisted Optimizely Development**
   - Transform generic AI responses into precise, Optimizely-specific guidance
   - Eliminate irrelevant information that confuses AI models
   - Provide contextual intelligence that understands the developer's specific situation

### 2. **Solve the AI Context Problem**
   - Prevent AI from providing outdated or incorrect Optimizely information
   - Ensure AI responses are relevant to the specific Optimizely products being used
   - Filter out non-Optimizely queries to maintain focus and accuracy

### 3. **Enable Intelligent Product Detection**
   - Automatically identify multiple Optimizely products in complex solutions
   - Support the full range of Optimizely products (10+ product families)
   - Provide seamless context switching between different product combinations

### 4. **Create Self-Improving Development Intelligence**
   - Learn from successful developer interactions and patterns
   - Evolve IDE rules based on proven best practices
   - Build and maintain a knowledge base that improves over time

### 5. **Simplify Integration and Deployment**
   - Provide zero-configuration setup for immediate productivity
   - Support both local NPM installation and cloud deployment
   - Integrate seamlessly with existing development workflows
