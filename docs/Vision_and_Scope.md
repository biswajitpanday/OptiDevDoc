# OptiDevDoc - Vision and Scope Document

## Project Overview
OptiDevDoc is a revolutionary product-aware development assistant designed specifically for Optimizely developers. It provides intelligent guidance, pattern analysis, and documentation search across all Optimizely products (Commerce, CMS, DXP, Experimentation) with perfect isolation between different product contexts. The tool serves as an AI-powered companion that understands the specific Optimizely product context and provides relevant, targeted assistance.

## Objectives
1. **Enable Product-Aware Development**
   - Automatically detect which Optimizely product is being used
   - Provide product-specific guidance without cross-contamination
   - Ensure rules for one product never interfere with another

2. **Improve Developer Efficiency**
   - Reduce context-switching time between different Optimizely products
   - Accelerate development through intelligent pattern recognition
   - Streamline bug resolution with product-specific solutions

3. **Enhance Knowledge Sharing**
   - Facilitate best practices adoption across teams
   - Enable portable development rules across machines
   - Provide consistent guidance across all Optimizely products

4. **Simplify Development Setup**
   - Offer zero-configuration deployment options
   - Support multiple deployment modes for different team needs
   - Enable seamless integration with development environments

## Target Users

   - Startup time < 5 seconds
   - Memory footprint suitable for developer machines

3. **Compatibility**
   - Windows/Mac/Linux support
   - Node.js version >= 18.0.0
   - Network connectivity for remote features

### Business Constraints
1. **Product Scope**
   - Focus on Optimizely products only
   - Limited to development assistance
   - No direct integration with Optimizely services

2. **Deployment Options**
