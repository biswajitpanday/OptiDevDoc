# OptiDevDoc MCP Tool - Comprehensive Implementation Guide

## Project Overview & Business Case

**OptiDevDoc** is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool that provides real-time Optimizely documentation context to AI coding assistants, designed specifically for senior Optimizely developers working with B2B Commerce and related products.

### Core Objectives
- **Primary Goal**: Enhance AI-assisted coding with up-to-date Optimizely documentation
- **Target Users**: Senior Optimizely developers using Cursor, VS Code, and other MCP-compatible IDEs
- **Key Value**: Eliminate outdated code suggestions and hallucinated APIs in Optimizely development
- **Unique Differentiator**: Deep Optimizely product knowledge with B2B commerce specialization

### Business Value & ROI
- **Time Savings**: 20+ minutes/day per developer (100+ hours/year savings)
- **Quality Improvement**: Reduced bugs from deprecated API usage
- **Productivity Boost**: Faster feature development with accurate architectural context
- **Team Knowledge**: Shared documentation insights across team members
- **ROI**: 1,200%+ first-year return on investment for 10-developer team

### Technology Stack Rationale
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+ with TypeScript (best MCP SDK support, team expertise)
- **Framework**: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk (official protocol implementation)
- **Search**: Hybrid semantic + keyword indexing (accuracy + performance balance)
- **Database**: SQLite (local) + PostgreSQL (remote) for zero-config + scalability
- **Deployment**: Render.com free tier (zero cost, team sharing capability)
- **IDE Support**: Universal MCP compatibility (works with all major IDEs)
