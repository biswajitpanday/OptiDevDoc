# Optivise - Project Plan

## Project Overview

Optivise represents a complete architectural reimagining focused on intelligent AI context curation for Optimizely developers. This project transitions from the complex multi-tool approach to a streamlined, single-purpose MCP tool that provides curated, contextual information to LLMs for enhanced AI-assisted development.

## Project Transformation

**Previous Approach**: Multiple MCP tools with complex deployment options  
**New Approach**: Single intelligent context analyzer with simplified architecture  
**Transformation Status**: Planning & Documentation Phase  

## Legacy System Assessment

### Previous Implementation Analysis
**Status**: Complex architecture identified for simplification  
**Key Issues Identified**:
- Dual MCP server implementations causing maintenance overhead
- Babel transpilation adding unnecessary complexity
- Multiple deployment modes creating feature parity challenges
- Complex multi-tool architecture reducing focus and effectiveness

### Architectural Decision: Complete Reimagining
**Rationale**: User feedback and analysis revealed need for focused, intelligent context curation rather than feature-heavy toolkit  
**Approach**: Clean slate development with simplified, purpose-built architecture
